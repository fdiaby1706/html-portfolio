<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I’m Fatima, a 24-year-old future Full Stack Web Developer with a love for creativity and problem-solving.
   I was born and raised in the Netherlands but made a big move to the suburbs of Paris, France, at 18. 
   These days, I’m fluent in Dutch, English, and French, which definitely comes in handy whether I’m chatting with people
   or diving into multilingual projects.</p>

<p>I’ve always had a knack for technology and computers, so it felt natural to pursue web development.
   Right now, I’m sharpening my skills with Dr. Angela Yu’s Full Stack Web Developer course on Udemy, 
   learning everything from HTML to JavaScript, and loving every minute of it.</p>

<p>When I’m not coding, I enjoy spending time with my family, trying out new restaurants, or catching the latest movies.
   I’m a bit of a homebody, so you’ll often find me unwinding at home with a slice of pizza and a good series.</p>

<p>My goal is to create websites that are not just functional but also enjoyable to use. 
  Feel free to take a look at my work—I’d love to hear from you and maybe even collaborate on something amazing!</p>
